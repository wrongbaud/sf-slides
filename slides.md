- There are not many components on the underside of the PCB
- The silk screen gives us more information about the test pads
  - IO lines for buttons
  - FPC connector for USB/3.5mm PCB 

---

# Hardware Teardown: Component Overview

- Based on our hardware teardown, we now know:
  - Utilizes on G20 ARM
  - Contains a SPI flash chip
  - Has a potential debug header (```GND```/```TX```)
- Next we will examine our two potential interfaces
  - UART
  - SPI

---

# UART: Overview

- UART = Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter
    - Asynchronous = no external clock
    - Often referred to simply as “serial”

- Used to transmit and receive serial data between two components

- Utilizes two lines, Tx and Rx
    - Tx = Transmit
    - Rx = Receive
  
![bg right:30% auto ](images/uart1.png)

---

# UART: Pi Interfacing
- ```TXD0/IO14``` = Transmit
- ```RXD0/IO15``` = Receive
- Can be accessed via ```/dev/ttyS0```
![bg right 75%](images/pi-gpio-uart.svg)

---

# UART Tools: ```screen```/```minicom```

- The Unix tool screen can be used to access serial ports
  - ```screen /path/to/device baudrate```
  - Exit by pressing ```Ctrl-a``` then ```k```
- ```minicom``` can also be used to interact with serial ports and provides
additional features
  - ```sudo minicom -b baudrate /path/to/device```
  - Allows more complex settings to be saved in a config file

---

# SF2: UART Access

![bg right 60%](images/pcb-serial.jpg)
- We will connect to the cabinet's serial debug header with a baudrate of ```115200```
- ```sudo screen /dev/ttyS0 115200```

# SF2 UART Access

- The debug logs for this device are very verbose
  - Over 14kb of data!
- While the information is useful, we are not given a shell or any other kind of access
  - This is still useful for debugging
- Some interesting strings appear in the logfile:
  - ```EPOS_MEM_DBG ON?, log_mem:0x0```
  - ```fba_open:d:\game\sf2ceua.zip```
  - ```read hiscore file, szFilename:e:\sf2ceua.hi, fp:-1037855776```

---

# SF2: UART Access Conclusion
- With this UART we can get access to debug logs
  - There is no ```Rx``` line, so we can only receive data from the target
- The debug logs tell us the following:
  - The EPOS RTOS is likely being used
  - The SF2 ROM is likely a standard MAME ROM
- The application being used is [FB Alpha](https://github.com/barry65536/FBAlpha)
  - ```FB Alpha``` is an [arcade emulator!](https://www.fbalpha.com/)
- To learn more, we will need to try to dump the flash

---

# SPI Flash Extraction

- We have identified the component which likely holds our data
    - ```EN25QH64```
- SPI flash chips can be extracted in circuit (without removing them)
    - We will use a Raspberry Pi for this

---

# Serial Peripheral Interface

- SPI is a synchronous serial communications interface
  - Commonly used for external sensors, SPI flash, etc
- SPI is operated in a full duplex mode
  - This means that both lines can be used at once
- It requires 4 lines to be implemented
  - ```CS```/```CLK```/```SDI```/```SDO```
- The protocol utilizes a host/target paradigm

---

# SPI: Pin Usage / Definition

| Pin | Usage | 
| --- | ----- | 
| Chip Select (CS) | Used to select the appropriate device on the SPI bus that the host wishes to communicate with | 
| Clock (CLK) | Clock signal that is host generated; data is sampled based on the configured SPI mode | 
| Serial Data Out (SDO/MOSI) | Used to send data to the target device from the host, commands are issued through this line |
| Serial Data In (SDI/MISO) | Responses from the target device are sent over this line |

# SPI Tools: ```flashrom```

- Flashrom is an open source utility that can be used to read and write SPI flash memory
  - Many chips and targets are supported
  - Adding additional chips is straightforward
- Flashrom can be run from the Raspberry Pi!
  - Check out the man pages: man flashrom

---

# SPI Tools: ```flashrom```

- Flashrom can interract with multiple hardware devices, referred to as "programmers"
  - FT2232h (FTDI)
  - Linux SPI Peripherals (Like the one on the Pi!)
  - [More are listed in the documentation](https://flashrom.org/Supported_programmers)
- The programmer is specified with the ```-p``` argument 

---

# SPI Tools: ```flashrom```
## Programmer Selection

- An example programmer argument can be seen below:
  - ```-p linux_spi:dev=/dev/spidev0.0,spispeed=800```
- ```linux_spi``` 
  - Linux based spi subsystem is to be used
- ```dev=/dev/spidev0.0``` 
  - Path to SPI device
- ```spispeed=800```
  - Clock speed to be used (in Khz)

- In addition to running ```binwalk``` and ```strings```, examine the beginning of the file for header information
  - ```hexdump -C -n512 file.bin```
- When examining firmware headers look for:
  - Start addresses (```0x80000000```, etc)
  - Branch instructions (architecture dependent)
  - Size fields / possible checksums

# SPI Flash Analysis

- Now that the SPI flash has been extracted, we will attempt to understand the boot process
  - How many stages are there in the boot process?
  - Are there any stages that we can interrupt?
- We also need to answer the following questions:
  - What OS is in use? (if any)
  - What filesystem(s) are used?

---

# SPI Flash Analysis

![bg right 80%](images/boot-strings.png)
- Here we see some debug strings 
  - Are these present in our serial logs?

---

# Understanding the Boot Process


```

dram init successed,size is 64 
jump to BOOT1 
DBG: boot1 starting! 
DBG: init key OK 
before check_key_to_fel. 
```

---

# Understanding the Boot Process

- After further analysis of the flash, there are two possible boot images:
  - ```eGON.BT0``` at address ```0```
  - ```eGON.BT1``` at address ```0x6000```
- In both boot images, there are references to jump to ```fel```
- After researching ```FEL``` we find the following on the [Allwinner website](https://linux-sunxi.org/FEL)

```
FEL is a low-level subroutine contained in the BootROM on Allwinner devices. It is used for initial programming and recovery of devices using USB. 
```

---

# Understanding FEL Mode

- FEL is a low-level subroutine contained in the BootROM on Allwinner devices.
  - It is used for initial programming and recovery of devices using USB.
- Devices must enter ```FEL``` mode, causing them to present themselves as a USB device
  - ```FEL``` mode is entered by holding certain IO lines on boot
- **If** this mode is present on our cabinet, how might we trigger it? 

---

# Understanding FEL Mode

- After testing, it was discovered that holding volume down during startup causes ```FEL``` mode to be entered

```
[129080.108765] usb 1-1.1: new full-speed USB device number 16 using xhci_hcd
[129080.251695] usb 1-1.1: New USB device found, idVendor=1f3a, idProduct=efe8, bcdDevice= 2.b3
[129080.251718] usb 1-1.1: New USB device strings: Mfr=0, Product=0, SerialNumber=0
```

---

# SPI Flash: Analysis

- Based on our initial analysis of the SPI flash we know the following:
  - There is a two stage bootloader
  - ```FEL``` mode can be entered on startup
  - The CPU is an Allwinner Series CPU
  - FB Alpha Emulation software is in use
  - The SF2 ROM in use is likely a standard one
    - It matches the same structure as the typical MAME ROM

---

# Using FEL Mode

- We can enter ```FEL``` mode, causing the cabinet to present itself as a USB device
  - What can we do with this?

```
before check_key_to_fel. 
===     key_type =1    === 
port0:1 
port_num0:0 
key_value:0 
times up, detect io jump to fel. 
key found, jump to fel
```

---
# Using FEL Mode

- In order to communciate with the device in ```FEL``` mode, we need to build the ```sunxi-tools```
- After building this software, the ```FEL``` version can be queried as shown below:

```
pi@voidstar:~/sf2/sunxi-tools $ sudo ./sunxi-fel version 
Warning: no 'soc_sram_info' data for your SoC (id=1663) 
AWUSBFEX soc=00001663(unknown) 00000001 ver=0001 44 08 scratchpad=00007e00 00000000 00000000
```


---

# Using FEL Mode
- The standard ```FEL``` tools do not have support for our chip ID
- After searching through github using the chip ID [a fork of this repo](https://github.com/Icenowy/sunxi-tools/tree/f1c100s-spiflash) was found that supports our chip!
- What can we **do** with these tools?

---

# Using FEL Mode
- Using the ```fel``` tools we can:
  - Read and write RAM
  - Read and write SPI flash memory
  - Load arbitrary firmware binaries into RAM
```
pi@voidstar:~/remove/projects/sf-cabinet/tools/sunxi-tools $ sudo ./sunxi-fel ver
AWUSBFEX soc=00001663(F1C100s) 00000001 ver=0001 44 08 scratchpad=00007e00 00000000 00000000
pi@voidstar:~/remove/projects/sf-cabinet/tools/sunxi-tools $ sudo ./sunxi-fel spiflash-info
Manufacturer: Unknown (1Ch), model: 70h, size: 8388608 bytes.
pi@voidstar:~/remove/projects/sf-cabinet/tools/sunxi-tools $ sudo ./sunxi-fel spiflash-read 0 0x800000 sf2.bin
```

---

# FEL Mode: Conclusion
- Using FEL mode we can now read and write the SPI flash over USB
- This is much more efficient than using the clips
- This method can also easily be employed by other people for their own testing!
- We still need to answer the following:
  - What OS/RTOS is in use?
  - What filesystem is in use?

---

# Understanding the OS

- Throughout our serial log we see multiple strings such as:
  - ```esMODS_MInstall```  
  - ```esDEV_Plugin```  
  - ```EPOS_MEM_DBG```  
  - ```L560(Esh_shell.c):Esh msg: shell main thread: Bye Bye!```  
- After researching these debug logs, it appears that the OS in use is ePOS v1.0
---

# ePOS v1.0

![bg right 90%](images/epos-architecture.png)
- Not much information is available on ePOS v1.0
  - https://epos.lisha.ufsc.br/EPOS+Overview
  -  Embedded Parallel Operating System

---

# Understanding the Filesystem

- Based on some strings in the binary, we see references to the following:
  - ```MinFS```
  - ```Fat16```
- A ```Fat16``` header can be found in the image, but the corresponding image doesn't contain anything interesting
- If we search MinFS, interesting table entries can be found

---

# MinFS Tables

- At ROM offset 0x24400, we see the string ```MINFS```

# Analyzying Unknown Headers: Where to Start?

- When looking at an unknown binary format, look for the following:
  - Length fields (before strings etc)
  - Size fields (of entire structure)
  - Pointers / Offset values
- Examining formats like this takes patience
  - Look for a parser if possible
  Google is your friend!

# Kaitai Struct: Parsing the Filesystem

- Using Kaitai we can not generate a python library to parse our structure
    - This allows us to easily parse them with the following code:

```
from minfs import *

target = Minfs.from_file("/home/wrongbaud/blog/sf-cabinet/output-files/ramdisk.iso")
os.mkdir("/home/wrongbaud/blog/sf-cabinet/ramdisk/")
for entry in target.minfs_file_table:
    if entry.flags != target.FileType.directory:
        with open(f"/home/wrongbaud/blog/sf-cabinet/ramdisk/{entry.name}",'wb') as ofile:
            ofile.write(entry.file_data)
```

# Filesystem Analysis: Examining the Binaries

- After running our script to parse the filesystem, we generate the following files:
```bash
pi@voidstar:~/allhandsactive/sshfs/binaries/output-files $ ls
adec_com.plg   aenc_xxam.drv    cedar.ini        display.drv       home.axf         lang.bin        sf2ceua.zip
adec_mp3.drv   aply.plg         cedar.mod        enter.wav         home.desktop     lcd_bright.reg  sf2ce.zip
adec_xxa3.drv  app_config.bin   charset.mod      epos.img          init.axf         logo.bmp        theme.bin
adec_xxaa.drv  app_config.fex   chord.wav        font16.sft        key_REF.dat      monitor.drv     uart.drv
adec_xxam.drv  ardr_sw.plg      close_scn.reg    game.wav          key_REF-New.dat  mp.drv          volume.reg
adec_xxas.drv  arec.plg         contra.fs        game_wl.axf       key_REF-old.dat  orange.mod
aenc_mp3.drv   auto_off.reg     default.ini      game_wl.axf.lzma  keytest.axf      psr_audio.plg

# Filesystem Analysis: Conclusion

- Using Kaitai we were able to quickly develop a parser for this filesystem
    - This was much easier than manually defining the structs in python!
- With the parser generated by Kaitai, we were able to extract all of the files from the filesystem!
- The parser also worked on the included ramdisk
- Next steps are to [further investigate their custom compression](https://github.com/wrongbaud/sf-cabinet/wiki/file-compression)
